This interface allows you to manage a Swiss-style chess tournament through simple commands.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Available commands

- **add player: <name>** : Adds a player to the tournament.

- **remove player: <name>** : **(Only before starting the tournament)** Removes a player from the tournament.

- **enable player: <name>** : Enables a previously disabled player.

- **disqualify player: <name>** : Disqualifies a player from the tournament. Disqualified players are not paired.

- **start** : Starts the tournament.

- **current round** : Displays the pairings of the current round.

- **score** : Shows the current standings of the tournament.

- **game: <white> - <black> => <outcome>** : Records the outcome of a game (1-0, 0-1, 1/2-1/2 or suspended).

- **redo** : Redoes the last round. This is useful in case you have changed the state of one or more players, or even
if you added one or more players.

- **help** : Displays this help message.

- **tiebreakers: <tiebreaker1, tiebreaker2, ..., tiebreakerN>** : Sets the tiebreakers and the order of priority
(fromthe left the most important and so on). Tiebreakers has to be always be specified in lower case an there is only
support for sonneborn berger, recursive performance, black games, progressive, performance, elo and buchholz.

- **config: <configPath>** : Set the path of the config file that specifies tiebreakers preferences in json format.

- **example** : runs an example tournament.


**Additional notes

- Enter commands one at a time and press Enter.

**Example

Imagine you have ten players already added to the tournament: Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eve, Frank, Grace, Henry,
Irene, and Jack.

You start the tournament using `start`. The system generates the first round pairings, for example:

- Round 1:

- Alice vs. Bob
- Charlie vs. David
- Eve vs. Frank
- Grace vs. Henry
- Irene vs. Jack

Let's say the following games occurred in the first round:

- Alice wins against Bob with a score of 1-0.
- Charlie wins against David with a score of 1-0.
- Eve loses against Frank with a score of 0-1.
- Grace draws with Henry with a score of 1/2-1/2.
- Irene and Jack's game is suspended.

You record these outcomes using `game` commands:

- game: Alice - Bob => 1-0
- game: Charlie - David => 1-0
- game: Eve - Frank => 0-1
- game: Grace - Henry => 1/2-1/2
- game: Irene - Jack => suspended

At this point, you can use other commands to see:

- `current round`: This will show the pairings for the next round, based on the results of the previous round.
- `score`: This will show the current standings of all players based on their points and tiebreaks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Pairing

The core of the pairing system is based on a priority queue with a comparator that prioritizes players with higher
scores and more games played with black pieces.

The player with the highest priority according to the mentioned criteria is taken from the priority queue and assigned
white pieces.

Then, the next highest priority player who has not played against this player is taken and assigned blackpieces.
The process is repeated until no more pairings can be made.

Players without an opponent get a point, but this does not count as a game and does not affect any tiebreak scores, at
least not directly.If errors are made when loading the result of a game, the game command can also be used to replace
this result, as long as it is a game from this round.

In case of having information about players who will be absent, and if the round has not started yet, it is possible to
disqualify these players with the disqualify command and redo the round with the redo command to avoid pairing them.
The same applies for players who are reinstated or for any similar situation.

It is also possible to add players between rounds, although this is at the user's discretion as it is not very
standard to allow this in the Swiss system. For the organization of friendly tournaments, this feature, in combination
with the disqualify and enable commands, is ideal as it provides great flexibility that would otherwise have to be
managed manually with pen and paper.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Elo

During the tournament, the players' Elo will change according to the outcome of the matches. This Elo will be recorded
in a database. This database is not a real database but rather a binary file that stores a map with the players' names
and their respective Elo. Players loaded for the first time, and whenever the tournament is completed successfully,
will be saved in the database located at the address indicated in the argument. If it is the first time, there is no
player database and it is not possible to create it manually since it is a binary file. In this case, a database will
be created in the same directory as the command window points to, the file will be called players_db.bin.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Tiebreak Systems

Tiebreak systems allow to define the ranking of players with more precision and can be combined with several different
priority orders.

The supported tiebreak systems are Black Games, Buchholz, Elo, Linear Performance, Progressive, FIDE Performance and
Sonneborn-Berger.

They can be specified in the desired order of priority with the tiebreakers command, from left to rightthe most
priority will be the one on the left.For the case of recursive performance, the principle of this system is explained
below, you can also specify the number of iterations with the iterations command. Keep in mind that a very large number
of iterations can affect the performance(of the application).	It is also possible to specify the path to a json
configuration file as a second argument or using the config command. The format of this file is easily understood with
this example:

{
	"tiebreakers": ["sonneborn berger", "linear performance", "black games"],
}

**Linear Performance

It is the result of multiplying the player's score by 400, then adding the average elo of the rivals and then
subtracting 400.

**FIDE Performance

It is similar to linear performance but the straight line is replaced by a slightly more complex function. The FIDE
performance is the sum of the average plus this function that depends on the player's score.

**Sonneborn-Berger

A player's Sonneborn-Berger score is calculated by adding the score of each defeated opponent and half the conventional
score of each drawn opponent.

**Progressive

A player's progressive score is calculated by adding the historical score value in each round of the corresponding
player. This system benefits players with more consistent scores over time, who started winning their games. On the
other hand, it hurts those who have made comebacks.

**Buchholz

A player's Buchholz score is calculated by adding the score of all opponents except for the score of the first and
last. It is one of the most used systems.

**Black games

This tiebreak system takes into account the number of games played with black pieces. The more games with black pieces,
the higher the score. This system benefits those who were more disadvantaged in the color (pieces) distribution. It
usually makes sense in tournaments of high-level players, where playing with black pieces really implies a
disadvantage.

**Elo

This tiebreak system simply breaks the tie by the final Elo of each player, that is, the Elo resulting from the
different matches during the tournament. It benefits those who have beaten opponents with a better Elo than the
average.

**Default configuration
If there is no specification for tiebreakers the default configuration is buchholz, black games, linear performance in
that priority order.

*Version: 1.0.0-ALPHA

*Important: This is an alpha version of the software, so there may be bugs or incomplete functionalities.
